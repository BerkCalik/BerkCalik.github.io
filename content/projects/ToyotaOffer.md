# Toyota Türkiye – Digital Parts Detection & Approval System

A digital parts detection and approval system used by Toyota Türkiye dealerships and headquarters.

Previously, when additional needs were identified during vehicle inspections, offers were prepared manually and communicated to customers via phone. This project digitized the entire process.

Dealerships now use mobile and web applications to create offers digitally, attach photos and videos when necessary, and send them to customers via SMS and email.

Customers can open the link, review detailed offer items with visuals, and approve or reject individual items directly from their device.
