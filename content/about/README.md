# About

I design and ship production-grade frontend systems focused on maintainability and velocity.

## Focus Areas

| Area           | Strength                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Architecture   | Scalable React + TypeScript foundations    |
| UX Engineering | Intentional interface systems and motion   |
| Performance    | Render optimization and payload discipline |
| Delivery       | Reliable execution with clear standards    |

## Working Style

1. Define architecture before writing feature code.
2. Keep routing, state, and data flow explicit.
3. Use design constraints to maintain consistency.
4. Build for long-term maintainability.
