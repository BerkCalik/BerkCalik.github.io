# Passgage – HR Super App

Passgage is an all-in-one HR super application designed to simplify and centralize human resources operations.

It eliminates software fragmentation in HR departments by bringing time tracking, shift planning, payroll calculations, leave management, and performance tracking into a single unified platform.

Instead of juggling long working hours, Excel sheets, and repetitive data entry, Passgage enables organizations to manage critical HR workflows efficiently — saving both time and operational costs.
