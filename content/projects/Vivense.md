# Vivense Furniture E-Commerce App

Vivense Furniture E-Commerce App is the official mobile shopping application for Vivense, a furniture and home decoration brand operating in multiple markets.

The application was developed from scratch and launched for both Turkey and the UK. It supports multi-currency and multi-language configurations, allowing dynamic localization based on user preferences and region.

The homepage is fully dynamic and managed through a CMS-driven component structure, enabling flexible content updates without requiring app releases.
