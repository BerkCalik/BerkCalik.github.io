# Evkur E-Commerce App

Evkur E-Commerce App is a multi-category shopping application offering home products and a wide range of retail items.

The application is built on top of a scalable e-commerce mobile platform that enables dynamic app management through a CMS-driven component system. Many parts of the application are remotely configurable, allowing flexible content and layout updates without requiring full app releases.

I contributed not only to the mobile application but also to the underlying e-commerce platform, implementing major architectural and structural improvements.
