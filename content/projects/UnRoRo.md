# DFDS U.N. Ro-Ro – Vessel Inspection System

A vessel inspection system developed for DFDS U.N. Ro-Ro to digitize and accelerate ship inspection processes.

Previously, inspections were performed using paper forms. The collected data was later manually transferred into Excel at the office, and the review process could take up to 2–3 months to complete.

With the developed solution, inspections are now performed directly on Android tablets in offline mode while on board. Once internet connectivity is available, the data synchronizes with the central system. Through the web-based management panel, reports can now be generated within seconds instead of months.
